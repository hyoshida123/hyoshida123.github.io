I am an undergraduate student who studies Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley and loves hackathons and basketball. Previously I had experiences with hardware such as Arduino and circuit designs but I am currently looking to shift towards software-oriented roles. I am working on a project using Django and PostgreSQL now. I hope I can leverage those skills in a backend or full-stack opportunity.
